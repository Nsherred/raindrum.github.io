I've been working on integrating the lookup tools from my [last post](/2020/11/01/this-blog-post-is-a-search-engine) into one unified search engine for legal citations. It reads a citation and tries to pull up the relevant statute or legal opinion. If you reference a *subsection* of a law, it'll try to go directly to that. Same for pincites in legal cases, though they're less reliable.

I moved the search bar to [its own page](../../../lawsearch) for easy access. You can find more information about it there.
