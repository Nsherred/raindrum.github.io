<hr>
<p>When I was working at the <a href="https://edn.la/">Eviction Defense Network</a> this past summer, one of my jobs was to put together jury documents&#8212;that is, sets of documents that would be shared with opposing counsel and eventually the court in preparation for jury&nbsp;trials.</p>
<p>One aspect of this was to collect all the evidence (various PDFs and images) and put it into a single <span class="caps">PDF</span> with cover pages for each exhibit. A related task was to list all the contents in a Word&nbsp;document.</p>
<p>When cases have very large amounts of evidence, and when the list and <span class="caps">PDF</span> must be updated upon receiving <em>new</em> evidence, it quickly becomes a hassle to do this manually. So, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/raindrum/exhibiter">a program to automate the process</a>. As long as evidence is arranged in folders and given meaningful names, the program can generate a <span class="caps">PDF</span> and exhibit list in&nbsp;seconds.</p>
<p>I hope to make more tools like this in the future. Eviction defense is too important to let its practitioners to get bogged down rearranging&nbsp;documents.</p>
