  <label>Nov 24, 2020</label>
  <p>You might&#8217;ve noticed that this website looks totally different&nbsp;now!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because I&#8217;m constitutionally incapable of letting things be. I migrated the site from <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to <a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/">Pelican</a>, a different static site generator that runs on Python instead of Ruby. I&#8217;ve been meaning to switch over, because …</p>

  <label>Nov 17, 2020</label>
  <p>I&#8217;ve been working on integrating the lookup tools from my <a href="/2020/11/01/this-blog-post-is-a-search-engine">last post</a> into one unified search engine for legal citations. It reads a citation and tries to pull up the relevant statute or legal opinion. If you reference a <em>subsection</em> of a law, it&#8217;ll try to go directly …</p>

  <label>Nov 01, 2020</label>
  <p><strong><span class="caps">EDIT</span>:</strong> These searches will still work, but there&#8217;s not much reason to use them since they&#8217;ve all been <a href="/lawsearch">incorporated into a single search engine</a>.</p>
<p>Well, sort of a search engine. It&#8217;s more of a tool for looking up federal laws by their section and subsection numbers, but …</p>

  <label>Sep 12, 2020</label>
  <p>When I was working at the <a href="https://edn.la/">Eviction Defense Network</a> this past summer, one of my jobs was to put together jury documents&#8212;that is, sets of documents that would be shared with opposing counsel and eventually the court in preparation for jury&nbsp;trials.</p>
<p>One aspect of this was to collect …</p>

  <label>Aug 11, 2020</label>
  <p>These are my organized notes from Suing The Police, a two-week class I took at <span class="caps">UCLA</span> Law in January 2020, with Professor Joanna Schwartz. I&#8217;m hoping to post more of my notes from other classes to the site, but it may be a&nbsp;while.</p>

  <label>Jul 26, 2020</label>
  <p>Maggie Gaffney, Michelle Zhang, Ilan Zur and I wrote this report for a class in the Fall 2019 semester at <span class="caps">UCLA</span> Law. Many thanks to Victor Narro and Ana Luz Gonzalez of the <span class="caps">UCLA</span> Labor Center, who provided invaluable&nbsp;assistance.</p>
<p>As part of the report we used an online tool …</p>

  <label>Jul 05, 2020</label>
  <p>I&#8217;ve decided to start a website to host my research and whatever else I may blog. With any luck, I&#8217;ll post some actual content to it soon. In the meantime, there&#8217;s not much to see&nbsp;here.</p>
